# Chime! 

## What the project does
Chime is a project that leverages the Twilio API to provide a text broadcasting service for companies and organizations to reach interested followers. It is a team project built for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the app
Eventually you will be able to use Chime online at Heroku or to download and install it locally, but it's not yet ready.
